# Workshop Ｗebsite

*Check out the demo [here](https://ashleyfhh.github.io/workshop-website/ "游標顯示")*

* This is a single-page website I created for a real workshop held in 2022.

* It can serve as a website template built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a small workshop or seminar.

* Don't forget to customize the images and introduction according to your needs.
